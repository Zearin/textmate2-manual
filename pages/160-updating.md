# Updating

By default TextMate will prompt you when a new version is available.

The _Software Update_ page available via :menu:`TextMate → Preferences… (⌘,)` allows you to change :label:`Watch For` to :menu:`Nightly Builds` which will increase the frequency, despite its name though, the there is no new build every night.

If you switch to :menu:`Nightly Builds` and there is an issue with one of the builds, you can switch back to :menu:`Normal Releases` and select :button:`Check Now`, which then allows you to downgrade.

You can also find older builds in :file:`~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate`.
